## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Core Mystery System
1. Create `mysteries.js` - contains all 5 mystery scenarios
2. Modify `game.js` to randomly select mystery AND culprit
3. Each mystery has unique clues for each possible culprit

### Phase 2: Dynamic Clue Generation
```javascript
// Example structure:
mysteries = {
  missing_cookies: {
    suspects: {
      bunny: {
        clues: [clue1, clue2, clue3, clue4],
        dialogue: {...},
        confession: "..."
      },
      cat: {...},
      dog: {...},
      mouse: {...}
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Expandable Content
- Easy to add new mysteries
- Easy to add new suspects
- Easy to add new locations
- Modular clue system
