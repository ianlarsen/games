        <h3>What results can I expect from Board &amp; Train?</h3>
       You can expect a calmer, more confident companion with a solid foundation in obedience. During the program, your dog will learn core commands such as sit, down, stay, come, and place, while also improving leash manners and impulse control. You’ll receive clear, easy-to-follow guidance on how to maintain your dog’s progress at home so the results last long after training ends.

        <h3>What is your policy on behavior and safety?</h3>
        <p>
          Safety always comes first. All dogs must be dog‑friendly and
          non‑aggressive. Please be upfront about any sensitivities or triggers
          your dog has—honesty keeps everyone safe. Additionally please be upfront about all quirks such as counter surfing and frequent escape attempts. Dogs showing
          aggression or signs of illness cannot continue services.
