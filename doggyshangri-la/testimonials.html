    <h2>What Our Clients Say</h2>

    <!-- Testimonial 1: Joseph P (Pluto) -->
    <div class="testimonial-block">
      <img src="images/pluto.png" alt="Pluto the German Shepherd" />
      <blockquote>
        Nicole was referred to me by a friend at work and named the 'dog female whisperer'! She was to work with my German Shepherd puppy named Pluto. Let’s just say that Pluto was Plutoing! She was not house trained or crate trained no matter how much we tried... After her training camp, Pluto came home a changed girl! She no longer was having accidents in the house, she was so much better on walks and her concentration was more focused... If you’re having doubts… don’t! This was a game changer for me and my family.

    <!-- Testimonial 2: Roberta M (Ernie) -->
    <div class="testimonial-block">
      <img src="images/ernie.png" alt="Ernie the dog" />
      <blockquote>
        Nicole is the best of the best! I literally cannot imagine anyone I would trust more with my dog's care. She is so caring, responsible, and skilled... Ernie goes crazy when he sees his lunch bag come out, since he knows he's getting to go hang with Nicole and romp around her huge, fenced-in backyard with all of his buddies. I'm so grateful to have such loving, attentive care for my pup and can't recommend her more highly.

    <!-- Testimonial 3: Mark G (Woof! & Ruf?) -->
    <div class="testimonial-block">
      <img src="images/woof_and_ruf3.png" alt="Woof and Ruf" />
      <blockquote>
        If my dog Woof! could speak, this would be written in joyful barks. What I can translate is this: Nicole Acquavella doesn’t just care for dogs — she understands them. She meets each one as a full personality, not a project. Our Mudi boys (Woof! and Ruf?) are intelligent, sensitive herding dogs, and she connected with them immediately... They are never anxious in her care — only happy, engaged, and deeply at ease.
