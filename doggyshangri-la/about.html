        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>
          My bond with dogs began in childhood with a German Shepherd always at my side.
          Sixteen years ago we adopted another Shepherd from a rescue, and our home
          quickly turned into a haven for fosters. In one busy year we cared for nearly
          forty rescues—each with its own story and set of challenges. Helping those dogs
          gain confidence and manners revealed my ability to understand and communicate
          with them. That experience planted the seed for what would become
          Doggy&nbsp;Shangri‑La.

        <h3>Our Training Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          Training should foster clarity, confidence, and calm. Because every dog learns
          differently, I customize my approach to suit their energy and needs. Our balanced
          training pairs structure with compassion: we set clear expectations while
          rewarding curiosity and effort. When dogs trust and understand us, they
          blossom. My mission is to build that bridge of understanding between you and
          your dog.
