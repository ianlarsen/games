[Nicole] was referred to me by a friend at work and named the dog female whisperer! She was to work with my German Shepherd puppy named Pluto. Let’s just say that Pluto was Plutoing! She was not house trained or crate trained no matter how much we tried. She was terrible at walks because she hated it. She would get distracted by other dogs and try to run off. We were at the point where we really needed some help. Thank god we found Nicole. After her training camp, Pluto came home a changed girl! She no longer was having accidents in the house, she was so much better on walks and her concentration was more focused. We will be sending Pluto back for additional training after her 1st birthday! If you’re having doubts… don’t! This was a game changer for me and my family.
