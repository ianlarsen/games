Nicole is the best of the best!  I literally cannot imagine anyone I would trust more with my dog's care.  She is so caring, responsible, and skilled with her care.  Ernie's goes crazy when he sees his lunch bag come out, since he knows he's getting to go to hang with Nicole and romp around her huge, fenced-in backyard with all of his buddies.  I'm so grateful to have such loving, attentive care for my pup and can't recommend her more highly.
