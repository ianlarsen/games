If my dog Woof! could speak, this would be written in joyful barks. What I can translate is this: Nicole Acquavella doesn’t just care for dogs — she understands them. She meets each one as a full personality, not a project. Our Mudi boys (Woof! and Ruf?) are intelligent, sensitive herding dogs, and she connected with them immediately in a way that was both grounding and joyful. They are never anxious in her care — only happy, engaged, and deeply at ease. When someone gives your dog a sense of belonging, you don’t forget it. That is the gift Nicole gives.
