The real problem is that people aren't exercising enough. – diverts from healthcare costs to personal fitness.", "When asked about his voting record on environmental issues, the candidate brings up his opponent's personal life. – changes the subject to avoid the question.", "You're complaining about the new office coffee machine, but what about the fact that we got a raise last year? – introduces an unrelated positive point to deflect criticism." ] },
          { "fallacy": "False Dilemma (Either/Or)", "definition": "Presenting only two choices as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist.", "examples": [ "Either you're with us, or you're against us. – forces a choice between two extremes, ignoring neutral or alternative positions.", "You can either support the new bill or you support crime. – creates a false dichotomy to pressure support for the bill.", "We have to either cut education spending or go into massive debt. – ignores other possibilities like raising taxes or cutting other programs." ] },

Therefore, everyone from that country is rude. – generalizes from a sample size of two.", "My grandfather smoked his whole life and lived to be 90, so smoking isn't actually bad for you. – uses a single anecdote to dismiss extensive scientific evidence.", "This one article I read online says that climate change is a hoax, so all the scientists must be wrong. – relies on a single source to form a sweeping conclusion." ] },

          { "fallacy": "Circular Reasoning (Begging the Question)", "definition": "An argument where the conclusion is assumed in one of the premises. It's a statement that proves itself.", "examples": [ "The Bible is the word of God because it says so in the Bible. – the premise (the Bible is true) is the same as the conclusion.", "He is a good communicator because he speaks effectively. – 'good communicator' and 'speaks effectively' are the same thing.", "You have to do what I say because I'm the boss. – the authority to be obeyed is based on the position that claims authority." ] },

What is light cannot be dark. Therefore, feathers cannot be dark. – switches between 'light' meaning weight and brightness.", "The sign said ‘fine for parking here’, so parking here is fine. – interprets 'fine' as good instead of a penalty.", "All trees have bark. Every dog barks. So every dog is a tree. – conflates 'bark' as a tree’s covering and a dog's noise." ] },
          { "fallacy": "Appeal to Ignorance", "definition": "Claiming something is true because it hasn't been proven false or vice versa.", "examples": [ "Nobody has proven that aliens don't exist, so they must be out there. – uses lack of disproof as proof.", "There's no evidence that this herbal remedy doesn't work, so it must work. – assumes effectiveness because of absent evidence to the contrary.", "No one has shown that ghosts aren't real; therefore, ghosts exist. – uses absence of evidence as positive evidence." ] },
