**Prompt for Creating a New Dot-to-Dot Game:**

I have a working dot-to-dot game for my 6-year-old son (OT sequencing activity). I need to create a new level with a different image.

**What I have:**
- Existing `index.html`, `style.css`, and `game.js` files
- A dot-to-dot game using SVG with a 1000×1000 viewBox
- Mobile-friendly with touch controls and audio feedback

**What I need:**
1. Help setting up temporary code to click and capture coordinates for the new image
2. The new image is: [DESCRIBE YOUR NEW IMAGE - e.g., "a cartoon dinosaur", "a fire truck", "a butterfly"]
3. Image file location: `assets/images/[FILENAME].png`

**Requirements:**
- Approximately 25 dots (can be more or less depending on the shape)
- Dots must be spaced at least 50-80 units apart (for small fingers on mobile)
- Path should change direction periodically to keep it engaging
- Trace the outline logically (outer edges, key features)

**Process needed:**
1. Add temporary HTML button and click-logging script so I can click points on my image
2. The script should log coordinates in format: `{ x: ###, y: ### },`
3. After I collect coordinates, update the `LEVEL` object in `game.js` with new dots array
4. Update `imageSrc` to point to my new image file
5. Remove the temporary helper code from HTML

**Current working structure:**
- Board is 1000×1000 viewBox that auto-scales to 80% viewport height
- Each dot needs: coordinates in viewBox space (0-1000 range)
- Dots are automatically numbered 1 through N based on array order

Can you provide the temporary click-logging code to add to my HTML, and explain the process step-by-step like last time?
